Workflow:

* run sphinx-quickstart from /docs, include autodoc
* change the conf.py path to sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('../'))
* change the html_theme to 'sphinx_rtd_theme'
* add 'sphinx.ext.napoleon'
* run sphinx-apidoc, with the sourcedir being ../wtphm
* delete the "modules.rst" output from apidoc
* copy and paste relevant parts of "wtphm.rst" into "index.rst" and then delete "wtphm.rst"
	- edited wtphm by removing :show-inheritance:. This stops the class inheritance from being listed in the docs, which isn't really too relevant anyway
	- edited wtphm to remove "submodules" heading, as it seemed to be redundant given that all headings below it are at the same level

Should then build!
