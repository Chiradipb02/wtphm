event_batches.py is deprecated, new functionality is in batch.py

the get_batch_features function in batch_clustering.py can be accessed through batch.py

The sil_1_cluster and sil_n_clusters must be accessed through batch_clustering.py

event_prediction.py is what is used to label the batches.

So, basically the ones to use are batch.py and event_prediction.py are the one to use
