# wtphm Library
This library is intended to manipulate events data from wind turbines (also called status or alarms data).

Batches of events are created, which are a sequence of events generated by the scada system during fault events on the turbines.

These can then be overlaid on scada data to label periods when certain faults occurred.

## API
The API can be found at :

## Usage Example

## Notes:
event_batches.py is deprecated, new functionality is in batch.py

the get_batch_features function in batch_clustering.py can be accessed through batch.py

The sil_1_cluster and sil_n_clusters must be accessed through batch_clustering.py

scada_labelling.py is what is used to label the batches.

event_probs.py is used to calculate probabilities that certain events will trigger each other
