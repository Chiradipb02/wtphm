The **W**\ind **T**\urbine **P**\rognostics and **H**\ealth **M**\anagement library
is intended to manipulate events data from wind turbines (also
called status or alarms data).

Batches of events are created, which are a sequence of events generated by the scada
system during fault events on the turbines.

These can then be overlaid on scada data to label periods when certain faults occurred.

More information on the batches and the process behind creating them can be
found in [1].

Information and critiques on some of the issues surrounding the data coming from
wind turbines can be found in [2].

Additionally, a part of the library deals with clustering together different similar
alarm sequences, explored in [3].

Overview of Data
================
The data manipulated in this library is turbine ``events`` data and ``scada`` data.

SCADA/Operational data
----------------------

The ``scada_data`` is typically recorded in 10-minute intervals and has attributes like
average power output, maximum, minimum and average windspeeds, etc. over the previous
10-minute period.

Event Data
----------

The ``event_data`` is related to any fault or information messages generated by
the turbine. This is instantaneous, and records information like faults that have
occurred, or status messages like low- or no- wind, or turbine shutting down due
to storm winds. It is assumed that events data has at least the following
attributes:

* ``code``: There are a set list of events which can occur on the
  turbine. Each one of these has an event code.
* ``description``: Each event code also has an associated description
* ``time_on``: The start time of the event

In addition, it's assumed that the turbine has a specific event ``code`` which
signifies return to normal operation after any downtime or abnormal operating
period.
