The **W**\ind **T**\urbine **P**\rognostics and **H**\ealth **M**\anagement library
is intended to manipulate events data from wind turbines (also
called status or alarms data).

Batches of events are created, which are a sequence of events generated by the scada
system during fault events on the turbines.

These can then be overlaid on scada data to label periods when certain faults occurred.

Overview of Data
================
The data manipulated in this library is turbine ``events`` data and `scada` data.

The `scada` data is typically recorded in 10-minute intervals and has attributes like
average power output, maximum, minimum and average windspeeds, etc. over the previous
10-minute period.

The `events` data is related to any fault, or information messages generated by
the turbine. This is instantaneous, and records information like faults that have
occurred, or status messages like low- or no- wind, or turbine shutting down due
to storm winds. It is assumed that events data has at least the following
attributes:

* start time
* end time
* event code
* description

More Information
================

More information on the batches and the process behind creating them can be
found in [1].

Information and critiques on some of the issues surrounding the data coming from
wind turbines can be found in [2].

Information on the clustering aspect of this library can be found in [3].


Usage Example
=============
*To be included soon!*

Documentation
=============
For a local copy of the docs, see docs/_build/index.html. Documentation can also
be found at ...

Change Notes
============
``event_batches.py`` is deprecated, new functionality is in ``batch.py``

the ``get_batch_features`` function in ``batch_clustering.py`` can be accessed through ``batch.py``

The ``sil_1_cluster`` and ``sil_n_clusters`` must be accessed through ``batch_clustering.py``

``scada_labelling.py`` is now what is used to label the batches instead of ``event_prediction.py``. ``event_prediction.py`` is currently still included for legacy purposes.

``event_probs.py`` is used to calculate probabilities that certain events will trigger each other
